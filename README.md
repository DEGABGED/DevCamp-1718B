# DevCamp 1718B Exercise No. 2 (Git and Rails)

The goal of this exercise is to help practice usage of Git and basic Rails. There will be no restrictions as to how you're going to implement the features, however you will be graded according to the cleanliness of your commits and code as well.

## Notes

This Rails app was generated using Ruby version 2.4.0 and Rails version 5.1.5. While the exact version of Rails isn't important, the version of Ruby is. [Installation instructions can be found here.](https://gitlab.com/up-csi/dev-resources/blob/master/installation-guides/ubuntu-16.04-lts/rails_rbenv.md)

## Specs

For the exercise, with this empty app, create a small forum app with the following functionalities:
- Can create a Post with a title, author, and text (all of which are strings)
- Can view a list of Posts with all the corresponding details
- Can view a specific Post

You can add more features if you want (eg. editing Posts, deleting Posts, links between pages), but the bonus this will yield will be up to 10%.

## Instructions

1. From this `master` branch, switch to a new branch named `develop`. You'll do most of your work here.
2. Implement the features over at least 3 commits (1 for each feature). Make sure the commit messages and changes make sense.
3. Take note of all Rails commands you used in a text file somewhere in the project home.
4. Once finished, upload the code into your own GitHub repository, and send the link to devcamp.submissions@up-csi.com.

A bonus of 5% will be given to those who will fork the repository and make a pull request instead. [You can read more about pull requests here.](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

## Hint

You can checkout the `hint` branch for hints on how to do the exercise. It contains the answer key for the exercise, but with a different model Articles instead.

## Resources

If you need help, feel free to ask any of the DevCamp mentors. You can also search for online resources, [such as the one used in the session.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
